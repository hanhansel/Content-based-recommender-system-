I built a content-based recommender system for a gaming marketplace using the provided video game dataset. The system takes the name of a game as input and returns five similar games based on attributes such as genre, platform, publisher, release year, and review scores. To achieve this, I first performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions, handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies like “tbd” in user scores, and clean the dataset for reliability. I then engineered features by encoding categorical and numerical attributes, applied similarity measures like cosine similarity, and implemented a recommendation function to retrieve the most similar games. Finally, I evaluated the recommendations by testing with different game titles, analyzing the relevance of results, and reflecting on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. This project demonstrates my ability to explore data, engineer meaningful features, apply similarity modeling, and build an interpretable recommendation system from real-world data.
